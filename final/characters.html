                    mascot of the franchise. Freddy Fazbear consistantly appears in almost every game in the series. He is
                    possesed by the child spirit, Gabriel. When Gabriel attented his friend's birthday party at Freddy Fazbear's
                    pizzaria, he and 4 other children were lured into a room by William Afton and got murdered. Gabriel got stuffed
                    into Freddy Fazbear, possesing him. In the first game, Freddy isn't very active until the later nights. He is 
                    stealthy and tries to hide from the cameras, but he also laughs at you to taunt you.</p>
